This website was built for beginners to explore Svelte. Open-sourced on GitHub and deployed on Vercel.

## Forking my project

If you want to fork my project, you can do so by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right of the page. This will create a copy of the project in your own GitHub account.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
