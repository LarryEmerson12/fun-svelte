## Forking my project

If you want to fork my project, you can do so by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right of the page. This will create a copy of the project in your own GitHub account.

## Download as `zip`

You can also download the project as a `zip` file by clicking the "Code" button on the top right of the page and then clicking "Download ZIP".

## Install depencies

Once you have the project on your local machine, you can install the dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

npm install
```
**note:** You can use other package managers like `yarn` or `pnpm` if you prefer.

## Developing

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start a development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```
to open the browser.


## Building

To create a production version of your app:
